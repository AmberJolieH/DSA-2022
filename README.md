# Data Structures 

    - Methods of storing and organizing data in a computer system so that operations can be performed upon them more efficiently. 
        - when data is unstructured it does not have a defined data model and or is not organized in a manner that is conductive to operations or analysis.

        - Data structures take the form of different layouts, each of which is efficient or inefficent in each operations scenario.The goal of the programmer is to determine which data structures are suitable for the data on hand so that data can be leveraged to solve problems.


## Arrays
* Concept
    - an ordered collection of elements 
    - every value is the same data type
    - in python they can only hold a sequence of multiple items that are of the same type
    - are not a built in data structure in Python
        - must be imported using array module
    - ** if performing math calculations then NumPy should be imported to use NumPy arrays**
* BIG-O 
    - space complexity wise arrays take up less memory than lists making them more space efficient.
* Application
    -
