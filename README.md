# Data Structures 

    - Methods of storing and organizing data in a computer system so that operations can be performed upon them more efficiently. 
        - when data is unstructured it does not have a defined data model and or is not organized in a manner that is conductive to operations or analysis.

        - Data structures take the form of different layouts, each of which is efficient or inefficent in each operations scenario.The goal of the programmer is to determine which data structures are suitable for the data on hand so that data can be leveraged to solve problems.
